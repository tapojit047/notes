# External DNS:
- External DNS, also known as public DNS, is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) that is used to translate domain names into IP addresses that are accessible over the Internet. External DNS servers are responsible for resolving domain name requests from clients located outside of the local network, and directing them to the correct IP address.
- External DNS servers are typically managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), cloud service providers, or domain registrars. They store information about domain names and their corresponding IP addresses in a globally distributed database known as the DNS root zone. When a client requests a domain name resolution, the request is typically directed to the external DNS server of the client's ISP or cloud service provider, which then looks up the domain name in the DNS root zone to obtain the IP address.
- Examples of popular external DNS providers include Google Public DNS, Cloudflare DNS, and OpenDNS. These providers offer fast and reliable DNS resolution services to internet users around the world.

## External DNS Kubernetes:
- External DNS in Kubernetes is a way to automatically configure external DNS records for Kubernetes Services and Ingresses. It allows you to create DNS records for your Kubernetes resources without having to manually manage DNS records.
- External DNS works by periodically querying the Kubernetes API for changes to Services and Ingresses. When it detects a change, it updates the DNS records for the associated domain name using a DNS provider API.
- To use External DNS in Kubernetes, you need to configure it with your DNS provider credentials and the domain names that you want to manage. You can install External DNS as a Kubernetes Deployment or DaemonSet, depending on your use case.
- One popular implementation of External DNS in Kubernetes is the open-source project called "external-dns", which supports many DNS providers such as AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS, and more.
- By using External DNS in Kubernetes, you can make your Kubernetes resources accessible through DNS names, which can make it easier to access and manage your applications. Additionally, it can help reduce the risk of errors when manually managing DNS records, and can provide a more flexible and dynamic DNS configuration for your Kubernetes cluster.

## External DNS and the operator:
- External DNS and External DNS Operator are two related but distinct concepts.
- External DNS is a tool that automates the process of managing DNS records for Kubernetes Services and Ingresses. It allows you to automatically create, update, and delete DNS records for your Kubernetes resources by interacting with the DNS provider API.
- External DNS works by periodically querying the Kubernetes API for changes to Services and Ingresses. When it detects a change, it updates the DNS records for the associated domain name using a DNS provider API. External DNS supports a wide range of DNS providers, such as AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, and Azure DNS.
- On the other hand, External DNS Operator is a Kubernetes operator that automates the deployment and management of External DNS in Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the process of configuring and managing External DNS by providing a declarative way to define DNS records for Kubernetes resources.
- The External DNS Operator manages External DNS as a Kubernetes deployment, with the ability to automatically create, update, and delete DNS records for Kubernetes Services and Ingresses. It integrates with multiple DNS providers, making it easy to configure DNS records for a wide range of use cases.
- In summary, External DNS is a tool for managing DNS records for Kubernetes resources, while External DNS Operator is a Kubernetes operator that automates the deployment and management of External DNS in Kubernetes clusters.

## Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):
- A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is a complete and unique address that identifies a specific domain on the Internet. It consists of the domain name and all the subdomains, each separated by a period or dot.
- For example, the FQDN for the domain name "example.com" might be "www.example.com" if you want to specify a particular subdomain, such as a web server. In this case, the FQDN would consist of the host name "www", the subdomain "example", and the top-level domain name "com", separated by dots, resulting in "www.example.com".
- FQDNs are used to identify and locate resources on the Internet, such as websites, email servers, and other network services. They are an essential part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can use to connect to those resources.
- FQDNs are commonly used in networking, system administration, and web development. They provide a hierarchical structure for organizing and accessing network resources and help to ensure that resources are accessible and identifiable using a standardized naming convention.

## Domain:
- A domain is a unique name that identifies a website on the Internet. It is a part of a larger hierarchical naming system known as the Domain Name System (DNS), which is used to identify and locate resources on the Internet.
- A domain name consists of one or more parts, called labels, separated by dots. The rightmost label is the top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, .org, or .net, and identifies the type of organization or entity that owns the domain. The other labels to the left of the TLD are subdomains that can be used to further identify a specific website or resource.
- For example, in the domain name "www.example.com", "com" is the TLD, "example" is the second-level domain, and "www" is a subdomain that identifies a specific resource on the domain, in this case a web server.
- Domains are used to provide human-readable names for resources on the Internet, such as websites, email servers, and other network services. They are an essential part of the way we access and use the Internet and allow us to easily locate and connect to the resources we need.
- Domains must be registered with a domain registrar, which is an organization that manages the assignment and registration of domain names. Once registered, a domain owner can use it to host websites, email services, and other resources on the Internet.

## DNS Records:
- DNS (Domain Name System) records are a type of data stored in DNS servers that provide information about a domain name and how to find the resources associated with it on the Internet.
- Each DNS record contains specific information about a domain or subdomain, such as its IP address, mail servers, and other related services. When a user enters a domain name in a web browser or other application, the application queries the DNS system to look up the DNS records associated with that domain.
- DNS records are important because they allow users to access the resources associated with a domain name, such as websites, email services, and other network resources. Without DNS records, users would need to remember the IP addresses associated with each domain they want to access, which would be difficult and inconvenient.
