# Deep Copy:
- Deep copy is a concept used in programming, particularly in languages where assignment operations create references to objects rather than duplicating the entire object. A deep copy operation creates a new instance of an object and recursively copies all the objects referenced by it, rather than just copying the references. This ensures that the new object is completely independent of the original object, and any changes made to the copied object do not affect the original one.
- In the context of data structures, especially complex ones like nested arrays, maps, or objects, performing a deep copy is essential when you want to duplicate the structure and its contents. This is because a shallow copy (copying only the references) would mean that both the original and the copied structure would still be referencing the same internal objects. Any modification to the internal objects would be reflected in both structures, leading to unintended side effects.
- Many programming languages provide built-in deep copy methods for simple data structures like arrays and maps, but for more complex custom data structures, you often need to implement custom deep copy logic. The process involves recursively traversing the data structure, creating new instances for each element, and copying their contents. Some languages may also have third-party libraries or utilities that assist in deep copying complex data structures.
- The need for deep copy arises when you want to create a separate, independent copy of a data structure, allowing you to manipulate and modify one copy without affecting the other. However, keep in mind that deep copying can be resource-intensive, especially for large or nested data structures. Therefore, it's important to consider whether deep copying is necessary for your specific use case and explore alternatives if possible.
- To deep copy a variable:
```go
func deepCopy(src interface{}) interface{} {
	var copy interface{}
	data, _ := json.Marshal(src)
	json.Unmarshal(data, &copy)
	return copy
}
```
- A JSON-encoded byte array is a sequence of bytes representing data encoded in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for data transmission between different systems, especially in web applications.
- JSON-encoded data consists of key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. Here's an example of what a JSON-encoded byte array might look like:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isMarried": false,
    "children": ["Alice", "Bob"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Jane",
    "age": 28,
    "isMarried": true,
    "children": ["Charlie"]
  }
]
```
- In Go, a JSON-encoded byte array is typically represented using the `[]byte` data type. You can use the `json.Marshal` function from the standard library to convert a Go data structure into a JSON-encoded byte array, and `json.Unmarshal` to parse a JSON-encoded byte array back into a Go data structure.
- Here's an example of how you can encode a Go data structure into a JSON-encoded byte array:
```GO
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
)

type Person struct {
	Name     string
	Age      int
	IsMarried bool
	Children []string
}

func main() {
	persons := []Person{
		{Name: "John", Age: 30, IsMarried: false, Children: []string{"Alice", "Bob"}},
		{Name: "Jane", Age: 28, IsMarried: true, Children: []string{"Charlie"}},
	}

	// Encode the Go data structure to a JSON-encoded byte array
	data, err := json.Marshal(persons)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(string(data)) // Output: [{"Name":"John","Age":30,"IsMarried":false,"Children":["Alice","Bob"]},{"Name":"Jane","Age":28,"IsMarried":true,"Children":["Charlie"]}]
}
- In this example, the `persons` variable is a slice of `Person` structs. We use `json.Marshal` to encode the `persons` slice into a JSON-encoded byte array (`data`). The string(`data`) call converts the byte array to a string so that we can print the JSON-encoded data to the console.
```
# Shallow Copy:
- A shallow copy is a type of copy operation in programming where only the top-level structure of a complex data structure is duplicated, and the individual elements are not deeply copied. Instead, the elements are copied by reference, so the new copy refers to the same internal objects as the original data structure. In other words, a shallow copy duplicates the structure but not the content of the elements.
- Shallow copies are typically much faster and consume less memory compared to deep copies because they do not involve recursively copying all the elements of a data structure. However, the downside is that changes made to the elements inside the copied data structure will also affect the original data structure, leading to potential side effects. This behavior can be advantageous in certain situations when you want to share some data between different parts of your program.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	originalMap := map[string]int{
		"apple":  1,
		"banana": 2,
		"cherry": 3,
	}

	// Creating a shallow copy of the original map
	shallowCopyMap := originalMap

	// Modifying the shallow copy
	shallowCopyMap["banana"] = 20

	// Both the original and the shallow copy are affected
	fmt.Println("Original Map:", originalMap) // Output: map[apple:1 banana:20 cherry:3]
	fmt.Println("Shallow Copy Map:", shallowCopyMap) // Output: map[apple:1 banana:20 cherry:3]
}
```
- In this example, we create an `originalMap` with three key-value pairs. Then, we create a shallow copy of the `originalMap` by assigning it to a new variable called `shallowCopyMap`. When we modify the value associated with the key "banana" in the shallow copy, it also affects the `originalMap`. This demonstrates that both the original map and the shallow copy point to the same underlying data.
