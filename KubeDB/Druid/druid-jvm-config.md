-  **JVM heap space**:
  - The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) heap space is a region of memory allocated by the JVM for storing objects created by Java applications during runtime. It's essentially the primary storage area for all objects created by a Java program. The heap space is where objects are allocated when you use the "new" keyword in Java to instantiate an object.
  - When the heap space becomes full, the garbage collector (GC) runs to reclaim memory by deallocating objects that are no longer referenced by the program. The garbage collector performs different strategies, such as mark and sweep or generational garbage collection, to identify and reclaim memory occupied by unreachable objects.
  - The size of the JVM heap space can be configured using command-line options when starting a Java application, such as `-Xms` **(initial heap size)** and `-Xmx` **(maximum heap size)**. Properly tuning the heap space is important for optimizing the performance and stability of Java applications. Insufficient heap space can lead to OutOfMemoryError exceptions, while excessive heap space allocation can cause longer garbage collection pauses and decreased performance.
  - The memory allocated for the Java heap space, specified by the "-Xms" (initial heap size) and "-Xmx" (maximum heap size) parameters, is indeed taken from the system's RAM (Random Access Memory).
